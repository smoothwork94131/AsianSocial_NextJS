This would make it easier to see who is saying what, especially when the transcript auto-scrolls down. I think this is already a feature implemented but needs further improvement.\n\n- Inserting the responses mid-monologue. This would make it easier to follow the conversation, especially when there are long pauses or interruptions.\n\nI would be happy to provide more details about this feedback on my LinkedIn profile.

This improvement was something we had asked for when we first started working with Gong. Furthermore, I'd like to point out that Gong does not yet incorporate AI, which might greatly improve the caliber of our chats. The use of AI might offer ideas for better language and communication flow in today's technologically advanced environment.\n\nWhen someone attends a Zoom conference, for instance, and asks us a standard question like \"Hi, How are you?\" In addition to the typical \"I'm fine, thank you,\" an AI-integrated Gong may provide other options.

But they would have added even more value if they had walked us through all the decisions to be made at the very beginning of the project. There were some settings and configurations that we needed to ask for their support to set up. Also, the email and call recording sharing models are tied to profiles, but the basic sharing options are\n1) All\n2) Their Manager's Team\n3) People who report to them\n4) Their Own\n5) Specific Teams (as in people who report to a manager & that manager)\n\nThere is no option to define teams other than a hierarchical construct, which includes the manager. Thsi did not work for us. To ensure reps could see other reps emails/calls, but not see ones that were manager only, we had to manually add every sales rep to the Specific Teams option - this is cumbersome and could have been avoided if Gong would have a capability to have a defined grouping based on profiles.

Lots of reviews on the product itself, so I won't go on and on about that.\n\nIn terms of the implementation services we purchased from Salesloft, our assigned representative Marcus was top-notch.  There's literally nothing I can think of that could be improved - he was a kind human, very knowledgeable, patient, helpful and invested in our success and not just treating this implementation as just another \"transaction.\"  Trust me, I know how rare that is and how \"nothing could be improved\" sounds - but it's true.\n\nWe had some major personnel changes in the middle of implementation, and he took it in stride, extended our implementation period to accommodate, etc.  Marcus is a true credit to your organization, and given how important first impressions are, that's a big deal.  \n\nOffice hours twice a day, every day - with high-end, very knowledgeable resources *instead of* the typical office hour people at other companies who constantly say \"hmmm... I'm not sure, check with support\" is truly incredible.  They dig in deep to your exact scenario, offer up best practices, etc. \n- it's a fantastic resource.\n\nWritten documentation and videos are terrific.  Haven't gone through any webinars or the \"university\" yet, but will do in the future - I'm sure they are great as well.\n\nThe one thing I'll add to what others have said all over the web is that the flaky Salesloft browser extension is disappointing.

It would be great if there is a way to see when someone else picks up a call from within the same call queue.\n- You can't add a voicemail from an MP3 file.

I am having to take time to pull each of their reports individually (or I have been asking them to just send a screenshot upon submitting for ease of reference) and then go in and manually pull each deal into the correct category for each of my employees to make my teams' forecast accurate. Additionally, if I click on \"roll-up\" mode, it will show none of my staff has submitted a forecast when they have, and if I go and pull their report/forecast separately, it will show submitted. It could just be something in Kluster that is set up wrong, but I know our Revenue Ops team has inquired a few times and been told it's fixed, and we're still having this issue.

The feature allows me to search through Salesforce for accounts that haven't had activity for a while. For old opportunities, this has been such a great feature. I can now easily ensure I reach prospects that may have fallen through the cracks. \n\n3. Opportunity fields. With the chrome extension, I can easily change multiple aspects in Salesforce without having to look up each account or contact to make changes manually.

I can listen to calls at my convenience and provide feedback as needed. This has been especially helpful when we've had to step in to support a deal, as we can quickly and easily get up to speed on what's happened so far. The short transcript summaries, integrated into Salesforce, have leveled up our data quality, and context switching when understanding deals. \n\nOur sales teams loved the sidekick, and it's meant that every deal now has detailed notes, so I no longer need to follow up the team on keeping Salesforce updated. \n\nOverall, I'm really happy with Jiminny. It's a powerful tool that has helped me improve my sales team's performance. If you're a marketer looking for a way to support your sales team, I highly recommend giving Jiminny a try over some of the more expensive alternatives in Market.

The sales team now love using the platform and my data is better. \n\nAs a marketer, getting access to sales insights is one of the hardest parts of my job, because the teams can't aggregate insights from every call.

It is incredibly hard to use. I barely log into it at the moment because I'm using Dreamdata \n\n2. I can track in app data and work out what is working and what's not \n\nOne of the things I was really excited about with GA4 is being able to track post-signup activity on a subdomain but it turned out to be a pain to do this\n\nBecause Dreamdata has integrations with Segment and with GTM, I can just send data directly from those integrations to Dreamdata and build attribution reports around: \n\n- What caused the initial signup \n- What influenced someone to go from free trial to revenue\n- What my highest ACV accounts needed and then use that data to calculate ROI \n\nThey even show me a breakdown of TOFU, MOFU and BOFU activity and report based on that \n\n3. This is a product made for B2B SaaS analytics and attribution\n\nMost of the analytics products that are out there serve multiple markets. GA4 is made for e-commerce and for mobile apps predominantly but can do some of what SaaS products need\n\nBut Dreamdata is focused only on B2B SaaS and is, quite literally, a dream to configure because of that \n\nIn a sales-led model, you can integrate your CRM data directly and breakdown revenue attribution by deal stage – this is a game changer\n\n4.

With syncing running every minute... you don't have to imagine, it's available today with Syncari.\n\nIf I was building a new SaaS business today, and started thinking about what the martech stack would look like… before buying a CRM, MAP, DW. I would start with the data model first, rather than years down the road as most SaaS companies do. Then I would research an iPaaS type platform as the base and build up from there. There’s a world of them out there too. My preference is one that is thinking 360view first. Extra points for building a place to centralize all your relevant prospect, customer and product data too with self service — without having to pay for additional licenses just for report viewing.\n\nDown the road as your business grows and you need to migrate to a larger or different CRM, MAP etc… then your migration can occur in weeks instead of months or years. Looking to be acquired, or acquire other businesses? You can easily sync their CRM, MAP, DW and again, migrate their data into your unified platform relatively easily. Or vice versa!\n\nAs I mentioned above, even better is a platform that easily connects into most BI tools or has BI built-in.\n\nExperienced data folks know the above is MDM. They all dread MDM when it comes in after the fact, often rightly so. However, the last few years we’ve seen a renaissance of MDM, simply because it’s finally being done right. Finally leveraging no-code functionality to support the business user.\n\nMarketing operations teams are now being tasked with, or driving the projects themselves - to do MDM right.\n\nWithout MDM you get a mishmash of siloed operational flows being built by different teams across your individual platforms. Think about your stack today. You’ve got in-app analytics, map, crm, content attribution touchpoints, web analytics, prospect email cadences, customer email cadences, operational emails, enrichment and intent data. In many cases these aren’t connected.\n\nIf you could offload all your operational flows into a single platform instead of many, then have that data synced back across all your departmental platforms… that would be transformational!

It's really easy to connect everything, pull data in, then you have a lot of choice of what you can do. \n\nYou can't forget that a platform like this requires you to think differently about your data. Sure, you can use it just like any other integration platform and connect a few systems and be done with it. But the potential with it, is to go beyond just what your data warehouse and etl tools offer. \n\nSyncari puts the data in the hands of the business user and often, business users don't have the background to build out data projects. That kind of planning, onboarding and implementation requires some serious hand holding. For organizations that have data science teams entrenched in their processes, rolling out Syncari is going to require change management along with project management.

After reviewing many end-to-end and point solutions, Staircase stood out as the best choice for our team to best serve our customers due to its superior AI signal detection.\n\nStaircase has also proven to be the lightest-lift enterprise product I have seen and used, and when they say \"integrations in minutes,\" it's a stunningly accurate claim. Integrations with every tool in our stack, including CRM, collaboration platform, and call transcription, literally required zero IT support. The time to \"first value\" was fast in our initial pilot, giving us the confidence to do a broader rollout.\n\nTheir pricing model also scales well for our company, and there's a strong network effect at play as the more users join the platform, the more accurate customer health becomes. We also wanted to democratize access to customer insights for anyone in our organization without license barriers. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.",

While some companies may want a  solution that CSMs and others who support customers work out of every day, our approach was to enrich the experience using tools already well adopted to limit change management friction and potential new tool adoption issues I've experienced in the past.

Both newbies and seasoned VR lovers will have a smooth experience thanks to the simple controls. The platform performs admirably, too, with little latency or other issues during my exploratory periods.

        "what_do_you_dislike_best_about_X": "The absence of actual immersion is one of Sightfull's biggest flaws. The idea of travelling to other places through virtual reality is intriguing, but the implementation is poor. Although passable, the images fall short of the level of realism and detail required to genuinely transport users to the intended settings. The environs didn't make me feel as though I was admiring a famous monument or standing on a spotless beach—rather, they gave me a shallow, lacklustre sense. The total experience is diminished by the restricted immersion, which also leaves a disconnecting feeling. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.",
